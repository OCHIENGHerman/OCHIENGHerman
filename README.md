## Hi, I'm Ochieng Herman

I'm a Full-Stack Developer and Research Assistant based in Nairobi Kenya. I specialize in building efficient backend systems with Python and crafting interactive frontends with JavaScript/TypeScript. I thrive on logic-driven development, API optimization, and turning research ideas into scalable apps. When not coding, I enjoy teaching concepts in web dev and contributing to open-source projects.
