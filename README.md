## Hi, I'm Ochieng Herman

I'm a Full-Stack Developer and Research Assistant based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in building efficient backend systems with Python (Django) and PHP (Laravel), and crafting complex business logic on the frontends with JavaScript/TypeScript, with a focus on the React ecosystem. I thrive on logic-driven development, API optimization, and turning research ideas into scalable applications. When not coding, I enjoy teaching concepts in web development and machine learning, as well as contributing to open-source projects.
