## Hi, I'm Ochieng Herman

I'm a Full-Stack Developer and Research Assistant based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in building efficient backend systems with Python (FastAPI, Django, Flask) and Node.js, and crafting interactive frontends with JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Vite, Next.js). I thrive on logic-driven development, API optimization, and turning research ideas into scalable applications. When not coding, I enjoy teaching concepts in web development and machine learning, as well as contributing to open-source projects.
